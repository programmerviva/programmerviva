## 🧠 About Me

I’m **Vikas Vaibhav (programmerviva)** — a **Founder CEO TL Engineer**.

I started coding at a time when there were **no AI shortcuts** — debugging meant reading documentation, understanding internals, and solving problems from first principles. That foundation still defines how I work today.

- Experienced both **pre-AI and AI-assisted development eras**
- Focused on **engineering depth**, not surface-level tools
- Build **production systems**, not just portfolios
- Comfortable taking **technical ownership** and architectural responsibility
- Hands-on across multiple **core languages and ecosystems**

I value **clarity, maintainability, and long-term scalability** over hype-driven development.

## 🧩 How I Think About Engineering

- Fundamentals matter more than frameworks  
- Architecture decisions outlive code syntax  
- Readable systems scale better than clever hacks  
- Shipping is important, but **shipping responsibly** matters more  

> “Good software is not just functional — it’s understandable, extensible, and resilient.”

## 🔥 Personal Note

> I’ve debugged systems alone, with teams, without AI, and with AI —  
> the tools changed, but **engineering judgment still matters most**.
